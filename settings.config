####### Required variables
ALN_MAF_PATH=                   # path to input MAF (previously generated by 'cactus-hal2maf')
GENOMES_PATH=                   # path to input fasta containing a MASKED version of each UNALIGNED/NO-GAPS genome. These genomes must all be in a single file and sequence names (in fasta headers) must follow the USCS naming convention of '>genome.chromosome'
ALN_FAOUT_PATH=                 # path to where to save output fasta
MASK_ALIGNMENT_RSCRIPT=         # path to your copy of 'mask-alignment.R'

####### Optional variable
R_PACKAGES_DIR=              # path to directory where your R packages are installed (R default location used if left blank)
