### Required
HAL_PATH=                       # path to HAL alignment file from which the MAF is derived (step 1 input)
BED_CONFIG_PATH=                # path to two-column tab-separated file with genome names and mask intervals BED file paths (step 1 input)
BED_PATH=                       # path to BED with sequence intervals to mask in all genomes (step 1 intermediate)
GENOMES_PATH=                   # path to fasta containing a MASKED version of each genome extracted from the HAL alignment file (step 1 output; step 2 input)
ALN_MAF_PATH=                   # path to MAF alignment file previously generated by 'cactus-hal2maf' (used for step 2 input)
MAF_OUT_PATH=                   # where to save masked MAF (step 2 output)
MASK_ALIGNMENT_RSCRIPT=         # path to your copy of 'mask-alignment.R'

### Optional
R_PACKAGES_DIR=                 # path to directory where your R packages are installed (R default location used if left blank)
DICTIONARY_PATH=                # path to samtools dictionary file (default $GENOMES_PATH".dict")
CHROMLENGTHS_PATH=              # path to two-column tab-separated file with sequence names (all genomes; USCS format names) and lengths (step 1 output; step 2 input; default = $HAL_PATH".seqlengths")
